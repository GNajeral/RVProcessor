# RVProcessor

This is my final degree project I did for my Bachelor in Computer Engineering.

This project consisted in creating a RISC-V based processor simulator. It was programmed as an attempt to dive in the world of RISC 
and more specifically the RISC-V architecture. The simulator consists in a mid level implementation of every RISC-V instruction from the 32bit set,
alongside a simple memory pool with which the processor could jiggle.
